# Project Information

This is a _two-player snake game_ made in C++ using the library Raylib.

I've used a pre-made Raylib template available [here](https://github.com/educ8s/Raylib-CPP-Starter-Template-for-VSCODE-V2).

At the beginning, I was using [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zVlRXd8f7g), but after learning the basics, I continued the work on my own and made certain original modifications (notably, I've turned it into a two-player game).

## How to run the game

After downloading the project (and setting up the Raylib library), open the `main.code-workspace` file with Visual Studio Code. Press F5 to start the game.

## How to play

Press Space to start the game.

One player controls the snake with W, A, S, D and the other one controls it with arrow keys. Eat the appearing food to enlarge your snake. If your snake collides with (any of the following):

-   itself
-   map edges
-   the opponent's snake

you lose and the other player wins. **A CHANGE MADE IN MASTER BRANCH** If both snakes collide (with map edges or any snake body) at the same time, the game ends in a draw.

More updates on how to install the game will be provided here later.

Sample change on another git branch.
